# Stacks Arcade Agent Notes

- This folder is where Stacks contracts, tests, and scripts live for the arcade games.
- If you need guidance on building Clarity contracts, transactions, or testing:
  - Go to `../stacks/` docs. Start with `../stacks/stacks_essentials/` for curated topics.
  - Check `../stacks/stacks-shards/` for full coverage (sBTC, PoX, nodes, Clarity reference).
  - See `../stacks/AGENTS.md` for navigation rules.
- Keep changes small and checkpointed as described in the root `AGENTS.md`.
