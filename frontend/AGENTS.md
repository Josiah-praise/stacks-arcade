# Frontend Agent Notes

- This is the Next.js + TypeScript frontend for Stacks Arcade.
- For any Stacks integration details (transactions, wallet connect, Clarity contract calls), reference the docs in `../stacks/`:
  - Start with `../stacks/stacks_essentials/` (Stacks.js, Clarity basics, transactions).
  - Use `../stacks/stacks-shards/` if you need deeper topics (sBTC, node setup, PoX).
  - `../stacks/AGENTS.md` explains how to navigate the docs.
- Follow the checkpoint protocol from the repo root `AGENTS.md` when making changes.
